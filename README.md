A **robust, efficient, and extensible** data structures library written in **pure Go**.

This library is designed with:
- **Performance** in mind – low allocations, cache-friendly.
- **Concurrency safety** (optional) – safe variants for multi-goroutine workloads.
- **Ease of use** – clean API, well-documented, and consistent.
- **Production-readiness** – tested and benchmarked.
